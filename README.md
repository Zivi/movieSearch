# Movie search tool

This tool connects to the Movie Database API where it displays a search box to find movies and there is a list of the most popular movies. On search, a list of the matching movies will be returned. A movie from the list can be clicked where more information about the movie can be found. Navigation is available on the bottom of the screen to jump between pages.

This web app was created using React with JSX for the templating. React Router was used to update the links in the app.
